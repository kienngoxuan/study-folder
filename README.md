# study-folder
A GitHub Pages static site that publishes a local study folder's contents, providing a visual, grid-based portfolio/documentation hub. It syncs content upon push and allows direct in-browser viewing of structured files (projects, documents, notebooks). Large files are shown with a preview/description for optimized performance.
